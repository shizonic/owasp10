      <h3>Make more than $10,000 a day by staying at Home</h3>

      <p>
        Almost a decade ago, when I was just getting started as an entrepreneur, I remember thinking to myself, “All I want to do is make 100k per year”
        <br>
        <br>
        So I broke it down and realized “I need 10k per month.”
        <br>
        <br>
        (Young Derek was a math wizard, obviously).
        <br>
        <br>
        At that point, I didn’t even know what $500 looked like, let alone $10k.
        <br>
        <br>
        Yet, there I was, shooting for the stars – and getting frustrated.

      <h3>How to Enlarge Your Tennis <small>Racket Grip</small></h3>

      <p>
        Do your forearm muscles always feel fatigued at the end of your women’s league tennis match? Chances are your racket’s grip is too small. Don’t be too quick to run out and buy a new racket. A few quick fixes with a lot less impact on a Nestie's budget can come to the rescue. The easiest fix is to wrap an overgrip over the existing grip to add half a grip size. If this doesn’t do the trick, increase your grip a full size -- you’ll need a few supplies for this. If you don’t feel comfortable tackling this on your own, most tennis pro shops can help.

        <h5>Increase Half <small>a Grip Size</small></h5>

        Take the overgrip out of its packaging and unroll it. Most overgrips have protective, plastic film on the top side with one end cut on an angle. Start at the angled end and remove the film. On the backside of this end is a small piece of paper covering a sticky spot. Remove the paper.

      <h3>Lose 300 pounds in 2 weeks</h3>

      <p>
        Losing 300 pounds requires more than just going on a diet. To lose this weight and keep it off, you will need to change your lifestyle. Changing habits acquired over years that contributed to the weight gain requires discipline and commitment. People who are morbidly obese are more likely to suffer from heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, cancer and respiratory problems. Losing weight can decrease your chances of getting these diseases as well as improve the quality of your life.
